## Measuring Representational Style in the House: The Tea Party, Obama and Legislatorsâ€™ Changing Expressed Priorities

### (a) State the Research question

The research question is:

"How did Republicans respond to the drastic change in intstitutional and electoral context after the 2008 election?"

### (b) What data did the paper use?

From Grimmer [-@grimmer2014] himself:

> I use a collection of nearly 170,000
House press releases: every press release, from each House office, from 2005 to 2010.

### (c) What theory was referenced in order to interpret the data?  

Generally, Grimmer asserts the importance of Congressional communication:

> Communication is a central component of representation (Mansbridge, 2003; Disch, 2012).
Legislators invest time and resources in crafting speeches in Congress, composing press releases
to send to newspapers, and in distributing messages directly to their constituents
(Yiannakis, 1982; Quinn et al., 2010; Lipinski, 2004; Grimmer, 2013). 

Grimmer references two of his own works to justify his methods. One references is to the general method he uses,
a *text as data* method [@grimmerstewart2013], and another references the specific method he uses on the press releases, a Bayseian hierarchical model for political texts that he had previously used on Senate press releases to measure legislators' expressed priorities: the attention they allocate to topics and issues when comminicating to constituents [@grimmer2010].

Additionally, Grimmer also justifies the source of the texts he has chosen for analysis:

> There
is increasing evidence that press releases are a reliable and useful source for capturing how
legislators communicate with their constituents. Grimmer [-@grimmer2013] shows that press releases
contain politically relevant content not found in floor speeches and that press releases have
a direct effect over the content of newspaper stories and constituent evaluations.

### (d) Was the paper a descriptive study, an identification exercise, a
numerical solution to system of equations study, or some combination of
the three?

One the one hand, Grimmer utilizes hierarchical modelling, an unsupervised method, on the 2005-2010 House press releases as a means of reducing the dimensionality of more succinctly describing the information contained in the press releases.
